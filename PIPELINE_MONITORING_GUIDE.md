```

### Stage 7: 🗃️ Run Database Migration
**What to Monitor:**
- ✅ Migration simulation runs
- 📝 Migration logs display
- 🕐 Time taken: ~1 minute

### Stage 8: ⏸️ Final Deployment Approval (**MANUAL**)
**Action Required:**
1. Pipeline will **PAUSE** again ⏸️
2. Click the **"Input Required" button**
3. Select **"Yes"** to approve deployment
4. Optionally add deployment notes
5. Monitor the approval

**What You'll See:**
```
⏳ Final deployment requires manual approval...
🚀 Approve final deployment to production?
```

### Stage 9: 🚀 Deploy to Production

### 🚨 What to Watch For

#### ✅ Success Indicators:
- All stages turn green
- No red error messages
- Manual approvals processed
- Final success message displays

#### ⚠️ Warning Indicators:
- Yellow stages (Gitleaks finding test secret is normal)
- Longer than expected stage duration
- Unstable build status

#### ❌ Error Indicators:
- Red stages or build failure
- Docker build errors
- Test failures
- Timeout on manual approvals

## 🎮 Manual Interaction Guide

### When Pipeline Pauses for Approval:

1. **Look for Blue "Input Required" Button**
   - Usually appears in the main pipeline view
   - May also show in the Console Output

2. **Click on the Paused Stage**
   - Opens approval dialog
   - Shows approval options

3. **Make Your Selection**
   - Choose "Yes" to proceed
   - Choose "No" to abort
   - Add notes if requested

4. **Monitor Continuation**
   - Pipeline resumes automatically
   - Watch next stages execute

## 📱 Real-Time Monitoring Tips

### 🔍 Best Monitoring Practices:
1. **Keep Console Output Open** - Shows detailed real-time logs
2. **Watch Stage Progress** - Visual indicators show current stage
3. **Monitor Build Duration** - Helps identify performance issues
4. **Check Resource Usage** - Watch Docker container resources
5. **Review Manual Approval Timing** - Don't leave approvals pending too long

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting During Execution:

#### If Build Fails:
1. Check Console Output for error details
2. Look for red error messages
3. Note which stage failed
4. Check Docker daemon status: `docker info`
5. Verify network connectivity for GitHub/downloads

#### If Build Hangs:
1. Check if waiting for manual approval
2. Look for resource constraints (disk/memory)
3. Verify no port conflicts (especially 27017 for MongoDB)
4. Check Jenkins agent status

#### Manual Approval Not Showing:
1. Refresh the Jenkins page
2. Check if you have necessary permissions
3. Look in Console Output for approval links
4. Try clicking directly on the stage

## 🎊 Success Criteria

### ✅ Pipeline Completed Successfully When:
- All 9 stages turn green ✅
- Both manual approvals processed
- Final deployment message shows
- Docker images created and tagged
- No critical errors in logs

### 🎉 Expected Final Output:
```
✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL! 
📝 Summary:
   • Commit: abc123f
   • Build: 123
   • Image: nodejs-demo:123
   • Status: Successfully deployed to production
```

## 🔄 Next Steps After Successful Run:

1. **Switch to Full Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   mv Jenkinsfile Jenkinsfile.simple
   mv Jenkinsfile.full Jenkinsfile
   git add . && git commit -m "Switch to full pipeline with SonarQube"
   ```

2. **Set up SonarQube Integration** (for advanced features)
3. **Configure Real Production Environment**
4. **Set up Automated Triggers** (GitHub webhooks)
5. **Add Notification Integrations** (Slack, Email)
